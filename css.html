    <p>The priority level for changing CSS is-</p>
    <fieldset>
      INLINE CSS > INTERNAL CSS > EXTERNAL CSS.

    <br>
    <hr size = "3" noshade>
    <p>But we are always advised to use the external CSS which is better among these
    <br> If we use simultaneously inline , external and internal CSS then the priority will be given to the inline CSS
    <br>and the rest will be croseed out.</p>

    <table cellspacing = "20">
      <tr>
        <td>SELECTOR </td>

    <h3>SELECTORS</h3>
    <h4>CLASS SELECTORS</h4>
    <fieldset>
      <p>Use class in a tag lets say ex; body, h1,p etc.. <br>Give the name form which you can refer to it in the external
        CSS file <br>Use ('.') in front of the class name and then you can acess it as.
      </p>
    </fieldset>
    <h4>ID SELECTORS</h4>
    <fieldset>
      <p>For ID selctors it is kinda similar to class selectors but in external CSS we use
      (#) in fornt of the ID name .
    </p>
    </fieldset>
    <p>
      Well the only difference between them is ID selectors are unique you cannot use them again with the same reference
      so you would use ID to identify elements where there is only one of them on a particular page. You will get to access it only once whereas
      the class selectors can be addressed as many times you need.
      <fieldset>
        So use classes when you want to apply the same style to a group of
        related items and use the ID to apply to a specific style to a single element on you web page.And these selectors
        overrides the tag selectors.
      </fieldset>

    <p>Let's make CSS more interesting shall we? <br>
     We are going to change the icon at the top of our website name, we will visit a site
     <br><a href="https://www.favicon.cc/">FAVICON</a> You can create your icon from here.
    <h3>The new tag - "div"</h3>
    <p> A div stands for a  content division element , an it basically allows you to split up or divide
     your content into separate containers or boxes so that you can affect the layout of each box separately. </p>
    
     <h3>The box model in CSS</h3>
     <p>We know that every single HTML element is treated as box by css and by styling that box, changing its height/width, margin , padding, etc.
     that's how we can change the layout of our website.</p>
